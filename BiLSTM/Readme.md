   - Pad sequences to ensure uniform input length.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Construct a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural network.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

3. **Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train the model using training data with validation.
   - Apply Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on test data.

## **2. Detailed Input Parameters and Outputs**

### **A. Input to the Model**

#### **1. Raw Input Data:**

- **Source:** Your data originates from CSV files located at `./data/train.csv`, `./data/valid.csv`, and `./data/test.csv`.
- **Content:** Each CSV file contains textual data under the column `'statement'` and corresponding labels under the column `'label'`.

#### **2. Preprocessing Steps:**

Before feeding data into the model, several preprocessing steps are performed to convert raw text into a numerical format suitable for neural networks.

1. **Text Cleaning (`preprocess_text` function):**
   - **Remove Non-Alphabet Characters:** Strips out any characters that are not alphabets, replacing them with spaces.
     ```python
     text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
     ```
   - **Tokenization & Lowercasing:** Splits the text into individual words and converts them to lowercase.
     ```python
     words = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
     ```
   - **Stemming & Stopword Removal:** Applies stemming to reduce words to their base forms and removes common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is").
     ```python
     processed_words = [
         stemmer.stem(word) for word in words if word not in stopwords_set
     ]
     ```

2. **Label Mapping (`load_and_map_labels` function):**
   - **Purpose:** Maps original labels to new binary labels based on the provided `label_map`.
     ```python
     label_map = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}
     ```

3. **Tokenization & Sequencing:**
   - **Tokenizer Configuration:**
     ```python
     tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10000, oov_token="<OOV>")
     tokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_df['statement'])
     ```
     - **`num_words=10000`:** Limits the vocabulary size to the top 10,000 most frequent words.
     - **`oov_token="<OOV>"`:** Represents out-of-vocabulary words.

   - **Text to Sequences:**
     ```python
     X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_df['statement'])
     X_val = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(val_df['statement'])
     X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_df['statement'])
     ```
     - **Output:** Converts each preprocessed statement into a sequence of integers, where each integer represents a specific word in the tokenizer's vocabulary.

4. **Padding Sequences (`pad_sequences`):**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures all input sequences have the same length (`max_length = 100`) by padding shorter sequences with zeros at the end.
     ```python
     X_train_padded = pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
     X_val_padded = pad_sequences(X_val, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
     X_test_padded = pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')
     ```
   - **Result:** Each input to the model is a fixed-length sequence of 100 integers.

#### **Summary of Model Input:**

- **Shape:** `(batch_size, 100)`
  - **`batch_size`:** Number of samples processed before the model is updated.
  - **`100`:** Fixed length of each input sequence.
- **Data Type:** Integer sequences representing tokenized and padded text.

### **B. Model Architecture and Output**

#### **1. Model Components:**

Your model is a **Bidirectional LSTM** network designed for binary classification. Here's a breakdown of each layer:

1. **Embedding Layer:**
   ```python
   Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64, input_length=100)
   ```
   - **`input_dim=10000`:** Size of the vocabulary (as defined in the Tokenizer).
   - **`output_dim=64`:** Dimension of the embedding vectors. Each word is represented as a 64-dimensional vector.
   - **`input_length=100`:** Length of input sequences.

2. **First Bidirectional LSTM Layer:**
   ```python
   Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True))
   ```
   - **`LSTM(64)`:** Number of LSTM units. Each LSTM layer processes sequences with 64 hidden units.
   - **`return_sequences=True`:** Returns the full sequence of outputs for each timestep, allowing subsequent LSTM layers to process the data.

3. **First Dropout Layer:**
   ```python
   Dropout(0.5)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Prevents overfitting by randomly setting 50% of the input units to zero during training.

4. **Second Bidirectional LSTM Layer:**
   ```python
   Bidirectional(LSTM(32))
   ```
   - **`LSTM(32)`:** Number of LSTM units.
   - **`return_sequences` defaults to `False`:** Returns only the last output in the output sequence.

5. **First Dense Layer:**
   ```python
   Dense(32, activation='relu')
   ```
   - **`32` units:** Number of neurons in the dense layer.
   - **`activation='relu'`:** Applies the ReLU activation function for non-linearity.

6. **Second Dropout Layer:**
   ```python
   Dropout(0.5)
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Further prevents overfitting by randomly dropping 50% of the input units.

7. **Output Layer:**
   ```python
   Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', dtype='float32')
   ```
   - **`1` unit:** Single neuron for binary classification.
   - **`activation='sigmoid'`:** Outputs a probability between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the input belonging to the positive class.
   - **`dtype='float32'`:** Ensures the output is in floating-point format, compatible with mixed precision training.

#### **2. Model Compilation:**

```python
model.compile(
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    optimizer=optimizer,
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

- **`loss='binary_crossentropy'`:** Appropriate for binary classification tasks.
- **`optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3)`:** Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **`metrics=['accuracy']`:** Tracks accuracy during training and evaluation.

#### **3. Model Output:**

- **Nature:** The model outputs a single scalar value per input sample.
- **Range:** Between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the input belonging to the positive class (e.g., real news).
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Close to 1:** High probability of being in the positive class.
  - **Close to 0:** High probability of being in the negative class.

#### **Summary of Model Output:**

- **Shape:** `(batch_size, 1)`
  - **`batch_size`:** Number of samples processed in a single forward/backward pass.
  - **`1`:** Single probability score per sample.
- **Data Type:** Floating-point numbers (`float32`).

## **4. Practical Example**

To solidify your understanding, let's walk through an example of how a single input flows through the model.

### **Example Statement:**

```
"The government has implemented new policies to combat fake news."
```

### **Processing Steps:**

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - **Original Text:** `"The government has implemented new policies to combat fake news."`
   - **After Cleaning:** `"The government has implemented new policies to combat fake news"`
   - **Tokenization & Lowercasing:** `['the', 'government', 'has', 'implemented', 'new', 'policies', 'to', 'combat', 'fake', 'news']`
   - **Stemming & Stopword Removal:** Assuming 'the', 'has', 'to' are stopwords:
     - `['government', 'implement', 'new', 'polici', 'combat', 'fake', 'news']`
   - **Joined Text:** `"government implement new polici combat fake news"`

2. **Tokenization:**
   - **Tokenizer Vocabulary:** Let's assume 'government' is mapped to `1`, 'implement' to `2`, ..., 'news' to `7`.
   - **Sequence:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

3. **Padding:**
   - **Original Sequence Length:** `7`
   - **Padded Sequence (max_length=100):** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 93 zeros appended at the end)

4. **Model Input:**
   - **Input Vector:** A 100-dimensional integer vector representing the tokenized and padded text.

5. **Model Processing:**
   - **Embedding Layer:** Transforms the input vector into a 100x64 matrix where each of the 100 tokens is represented by a 64-dimensional embedding vector.
   - **BiLSTM Layers:** Processes the embeddings to capture sequential dependencies and contextual information.
   - **Dense Layers:** Learn to combine the extracted features to perform classification.

6. **Model Output:**
   - **Probability:** Let's say the model outputs `[0.85]`.
   - **Interpretation:** A 85% probability that the statement is in the positive class (e.g., real news).

7. **Prediction:**
   - **Thresholding:** Since `0.85 > 0.5`, the model predicts the statement as **real news**.

## **5. Visual Representation**

Here's a simplified diagram to visualize the data flow:

```

                                                        v
                                               Probability Output
```

## **7. Additional Considerations**

### **A. Batch Size and GPU Utilization**

- **Batch Size (`batch_size=64`):** Determines how many samples are processed before the model updates its weights.
  - **Impact on GPU:** Larger batch sizes can lead to better GPU utilization but require more memory. If you encounter memory issues, consider reducing the batch size.

### **B. Mixed Precision Training**

- **Mixed Precision (`mixed_float16`):** Utilizes both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types to accelerate training and reduce memory usage.
  - **Compatibility:** Ensure your GPU supports mixed precision (most modern NVIDIA GPUs do).
  - **Implementation:** Set the global policy using:
    ```python
    set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
    ```
  - **Output Layer Adjustment:** The final Dense layer uses `dtype='float32'` to maintain numerical stability.

### **C. Early Stopping**

- **Purpose:** Prevents overfitting by stopping training when the monitored metric (`val_loss`) ceases to improve.
  - **Parameters:**
    - **`monitor='val_loss'`:** Observes validation loss.
    - **`patience=3`:** Waits for 3 consecutive epochs without improvement before stopping.
    - **`restore_best_weights=True`:** Restores the model weights from the epoch with the best validation loss.

### **D. Evaluation Metrics**

- **Accuracy:** Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Limitations:** May not be sufficient for imbalanced datasets.
- **Additional Metrics:** Consider using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## **8. Final Recommendations**

1. **Monitor GPU Usage:**
   - Use tools like `nvidia-smi` or TensorBoard to monitor GPU utilization and ensure the model is leveraging the GPU effectively.

2. **Experiment with Hyperparameters:**
   - **Learning Rate:** Adjust the learning rate for optimal convergence.
   - **Batch Size:** Experiment with different batch sizes to balance between training speed and memory constraints.
   - **Model Complexity:** Modify the number of LSTM units or layers to find the sweet spot between performance and overfitting.

3. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Enhance your dataset with techniques like synonym replacement, back-translation, or other NLP augmentation methods to improve model generalization.

4. **Use Pre-trained Embeddings:**
   - Incorporate pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec) to provide richer semantic information to your model.

5. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Implement cross-validation to assess the model's robustness across different data splits.

6. **Regularly Update Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN are kept up-to-date to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
